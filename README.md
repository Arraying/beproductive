# be productive!

**perfectly balanced, as all things should be**

Discord is a brilliant platform that allows users to come together and share interests.
However, it's also important to keep real life responsibilities in mind when spending time on the app.
*be productive!* is my Discord Hack Week project that aims to bring self control, time management and anti-procrastination measures to Discord.
